    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### About Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework assignment, we will use a Jupyter notebook to implement, analyze, and discuss ML classifiers.\n",
    "Knowing and being comfortable with Jupyter notebooks is a must in every data scientist, ML engineer, researcher, etc. They are widely used in industry and are a standard form of communication in ML by intertwining text and code to \"tell a story\". There are many resources that can introduce you to Jupyter notebooks (they are pretty easy to understand!), and if you still need help any of the TAs are more than willing to help.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using a local instance of Jupyter instead of Colab. You are of course free to use Colab, but you will need to understand how to hook your Colab instance with Google Drive to upload the datasets and to save images.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### About the Homework\n",
    "\n",
    "You will experiment with several different linear classifiers and analyze \n",
    "their performances in both real and synthetic datasets. The goal is to understand the differences and\n",
    "similarities between the algorithms and the impact that the dataset characteristics have on the\n",
    "algorithms' learning behaviors and performances.\n",
    "\n",
    "In total, there are seven different learning algorithms which you will implement.\n",
    "Six are variants of the Perceptron algorithm and the seventh is a support vector machine (SVM).\n",
    "The details of these models is described in Section 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to evaluate the performances of these models, you will use several different datasets.\n",
    "The first two datasets are synthetic datasets that have features and labels that were programatically\n",
    "generated. They were generated using the same script but use different input parameters that produced \n",
    "sparse and dense variants. The second two datasets are for the task of named-entity recognition (NER),\n",
    "identifying the names of people, locations, and organizations within text.\n",
    "One comes from news text and the other from a corpus of emails.\n",
    "For these two datasets, you need to implement the feature extraction yourself.\n",
    "All of the datasets and feature extraction information are described in Section 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will run two sets of experiments, one on the synthetic data and one on the NER data.\n",
    "The first set will analyze how the amount of training data impacts model performance.\n",
    "The second will look at the consequences of having training and testing data that come from different domains.\n",
    "The details of the experiments are described in Section 3.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Section 2. Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we describe the synthetic and NER datasets that you will use for your experiments.\n",
    "For the NER datasets, there is also an explanation for the features which you need to extract from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Synthetic Data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The synthetic datasets have features and labels which are automatically generated from a python script.\n",
    "Each instance will have $n$ binary features and are labeled according to a $l$-of-$m$-of-$n$ Boolean function.\n",
    "Specifically, there is a set of $m$ features such that an example if positive if and only if at least $l$ of these $m$ features are active.\n",
    "The set of $m$ features is the same for the dataset (i.e., it is not a separate set of $m$ features for each individual instance).\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide two versions of the synthetic dataset called sparse and dense.\n",
    "For both datasets, we set $l = 10$ and $m=20$.\n",
    "We set $n = 200$ for the sparse data and $n = 40$ for the dense data.\n",
    "Additionally, we add noise to the data as follows:\n",
    "With probability $0.05$ the label assigned by the function is changed and with probability $0.001$ each feature value is changed.\n",
    "Consequently, the data is not linearly separable.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have provided you with three data splits for both sparse and dense with 10,000 training, 2,000 development, and 2,000 testing examples.\n",
    "Section 3 describes the experiments that you need to run on these datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.2 Feature Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "The features of the synthetic data provided are vectors of 0s and 1s.\n",
    "Storing these large matrices requires lots of memory so we use a sparse representation that stores them as dictionaries instead.\n",
    "For example, the vector $[0,1,0,0,0,1]$ can be stored as `{\"x2\": 1,\"x6\": 1}` (using 1-based indexing).\n",
    "We have provided you with the code for parsing and converting the data to this format.\n",
    "You can use these for the all algorithms you develop except the SVM.\n",
    "Since you will be using the implementation of SVM from sklearn, you will need to provide a vector to it. You can use `sklearn.feature_extraction.DictVectorizer` for converting feature-value dictionaries to vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 NER Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the synthetic data, we have provided you two datasets for the task of named-entity recognition (NER).\n",
    "The goal is to identify whether strings in text represent names of people, organizations, or locations.\n",
    "An example instance looks like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    [PER Wolff] , currently a journalist in [LOC Argentina] , played with\n",
    "    [PER del Bosque] in the final years of the seventies in\n",
    "    [ORG Real Madrid] .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, we will simplify the task to identifying whether a string is named entity or not (that is, you don't have to say which type of entity it is).\n",
    "For each token in the input, we will use the tag $\\texttt{I}$ to denote that token is an entity and $\\texttt{O}$ otherwise.\n",
    "For example, the full tagging for the above instace is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    [I Wolff] [O ,] [O currently] [a] [O journalist] [O in] [I Argentina]\n",
    "    [O ,] [O played] [O with] [I del] [I Bosque] [O in] [O the] [O final]\n",
    "    [O years] [O of] [O the] [O seventies] [O in] [I Real] [I Madrid] .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a sentence $S = w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_n$, you need to predict the `I`, `O` tag for each word in the sentence.\n",
    "That is, you will produce the sequence $Y = y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_n$ where $y_i \\in$ {`I`, `O`}.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2.1 Datasets: CoNLL and Enron\n",
    "\n",
    "We have provided two datasets, the CoNLL dataset which is text from news articles, and Enron, a corpus of emails.\n",
    "The files contain one word and one tag per line.\n",
    "For CoNLL, there are training, development, and testing files, whereas Enron only has a test dataset.\n",
    "There are 14,987 training sentences (204,567 words), 336 development sentences (3,779 words), and 303 testing sentences (3,880 words) in CoNLL.\n",
    "For Enron there are 368 sentences (11,852 words).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please note that the CoNLL dataset is available only for the purposes of this assignment.\n",
    "It is copyrighted, and you are granted access because you are a Penn student, but please delete it when you are done with the homework.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2.2 Feature Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "The NER data is provided as raw text, and you are required to extract features for the classifier.\n",
    "In this assignment, we will only consider binary features based on the context of the word that is supposed to be tagged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that there are $V$ unique words in the dataset and each word has been assigned a unique ID which is a number $\\{1, 2, \\dots, V\\}$.\n",
    "Further, $w_{-k}$ and $w_{+k}$ indicate the $k$th word before and after the target word.\n",
    "The feature templates that you should use to generate features are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Template             | Number of Features |\n",
    "|----------------------|--------------------|\n",
    "| $w_{-3}$             | $V$                |\n",
    "| $w_{-2}$             | $V$                |\n",
    "| $w_{-1}$             | $V$                |\n",
    "| $w_{+1}$             | $V$                |\n",
    "| $w_{+2}$             | $V$                |\n",
    "| $w_{+3}$             | $V$                |\n",
    "| $w_{-1}$ & $w_{-2}$  | $V \\times V$       |\n",
    "| $w_{+1}$ \\& $w_{+2}$ | $V \\times V$       |\n",
    "| $w_{-1}$ \\& $w_{+1}$ | $V \\times V$       |\n",
    "\n",
    "Each feature template corresponds to a set of features that you will compute (similar to the features you generated in problem 2 from the first homework assignment).\n",
    "The $w_{-3}$ feature template corresponds to $V$ features where the $i$th feature is 1 if the third word to the left of the target word has ID $i$.\n",
    "The $w_{-1} \\& w_{+1}$ feature template corresponds to $V \\times V$ features where there is one feature for every unique pair words.\n",
    "For example, feature $(i - 1) \\times V + j$ is a binary feature that is 1 if the word 1 to the left of the target has ID $i$ and the first word to the right of the target has ID $j$.\n",
    "In practice, you will not need to keep track of the feature IDs.\n",
    "Instead, each feature will be given a name such as \"$w_{-1}=\\textrm{the} \\& w_{+1}=\\textrm{cat}$\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In total, all of the above feature templates correspond to a very large number of features.\n",
    "However, for each word, there will be exactly 9 features which are active (non-zero), so the feature vector is quite sparse.\n",
    "You will represent this as a dictionary which maps from the feature name to the value.\n",
    "In the provided Python template, we have implemented a couple of the features for you to demonstrate how to compute them and what the naming scheme should look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to deal with the first two words and the last two words in a sentence, we will add special symbol \"SSS\" and \"EEE\" to the vocabulary to represent the words before the first word and the words after the last word.\n",
    "Notice that in the test data you may encounter a word that was not observed in training, and therefore is not in your dictionary.\n",
    "In this case, you cannot generate a feature for it, resulting in less than 7 active features in some of the test examples."
