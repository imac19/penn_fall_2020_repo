    "- Handed Out: October 5, 2020\n",
    "- Due: October 19, 2020 at 11:59pm.\n",

    "## Preface\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feel free to talk to other members of the class in doing the homework. I am more concerned that you learn how to solve the problem than that you demonstrate that you solved it entirely on your own. You should, however, **write down your solution yourself**. Please include here the list of people you consulted with in the course of working on the homework:\n",
    "\n",
    "- While we encourage discussion within and outside the class, cheating and copying code is strictly not allowed. Copied code will result in the entire assignment being discarded at the very least.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Please use Piazza if you have questions about the homework. Also, please come to the TAs recitations and to the office hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The homework is due at 11:59 PM on the due date. We will be using Gradescope for collecting the homework assignments. You should have been automatically added to Gradescope. If not, please ask a TA for assistance. Please do **not** hand in a hard copy of your write-up. Post on Piazza and contact the TAs if you are having technical difficulties in submitting the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here are some resources you will need for this assignment (https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis519/fall2020/assets/HW/HW2/hw2-materials.zip)\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### About Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework assignment, we will use a Jupyter notebook to implement, analyze, and discuss ML classifiers.\n",
    "Knowing and being comfortable with Jupyter notebooks is a must in every data scientist, ML engineer, researcher, etc. They are widely used in industry and are a standard form of communication in ML by intertwining text and code to \"tell a story\". There are many resources that can introduce you to Jupyter notebooks (they are pretty easy to understand!), and if you still need help any of the TAs are more than willing to help.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using a local instance of Jupyter instead of Colab. You are of course free to use Colab, but you will need to understand how to hook your Colab instance with Google Drive to upload the datasets and to save images.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### About the Homework\n",
    "\n",
    "You will experiment with several different linear classifiers and analyze \n",
    "their performances in both real and synthetic datasets. The goal is to understand the differences and\n",
    "similarities between the algorithms and the impact that the dataset characteristics have on the\n",
    "algorithms' learning behaviors and performances.\n",
    "\n",
    "In total, there are seven different learning algorithms which you will implement.\n",
    "Six are variants of the Perceptron algorithm and the seventh is a support vector machine (SVM).\n",
    "The details of these models is described in Section 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to evaluate the performances of these models, you will use several different datasets.\n",
    "The first two datasets are synthetic datasets that have features and labels that were programatically\n",
    "generated. They were generated using the same script but use different input parameters that produced \n",
    "sparse and dense variants. The second two datasets are for the task of named-entity recognition (NER),\n",
    "identifying the names of people, locations, and organizations within text.\n",
    "One comes from news text and the other from a corpus of emails.\n",
    "For these two datasets, you need to implement the feature extraction yourself.\n",
    "All of the datasets and feature extraction information are described in Section 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will run two sets of experiments, one on the synthetic data and one on the NER data.\n",
    "The first set will analyze how the amount of training data impacts model performance.\n",
    "The second will look at the consequences of having training and testing data that come from different domains.\n",
    "The details of the experiments are described in Section 2.\n",

    "### 2.1 Synthetic Data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The synthetic datasets have features and labels which are automatically generated from a python script.\n",
    "Each instance will have $n$ binary features and are labeled according to a $l$-of-$m$-of-$n$ Boolean function.\n",
    "Specifically, there is a set of $m$ features such that an example if positive if and only if at least $l$ of these $m$ features are active.\n",
    "The set of $m$ features is the same for the dataset (i.e., it is not a separate set of $m$ features for each individual instance).\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide two versions of the synthetic dataset called sparse and dense.\n",
    "For both datasets, we set $l = 10$ and $m=20$.\n",
    "We set $n = 200$ for the sparse data and $n = 40$ for the dense data.\n",
    "Additionally, we add noise to the data as follows:\n",
    "With probability $0.05$ the label assigned by the function is changed and with probability $0.001$ each feature value is changed.\n",
    "Consequently, the data is not linearly separable.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have provided you with three data splits for both sparse and dense with 50,000 training, 10,000 development, and 10,000 testing examples.\n",
    "Section~\\ref{sec:synthetic-experiments} describes the experiments that you need to run on these datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.2 Feature Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "The features of the synthetic data provided are vectors of 0s and 1s.\n",
    "Storing these large matrices requires lots of memory so we use a sparse representation that stores them as dictionaries instead.\n",
    "For example, the vector $[0,1,0,0,0,1]$ can be stored as `{\"x2\": 1,\"x6\": 1}` (using 1-based indexing).\n",
    "We have provided you with the code for parsing and converting the data to this format.\n",
    "You can use these for the all algorithms you develop except the SVM.\n",
    "Since you will be using the implementation of SVM from sklearn, you will need to provide a vector to it. You can use `sklearn.feature_extraction.DictVectorizer` for converting feature-value dictionaries to vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 NER Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the synthetic data, we have provided you two datasets for the task of named-entity recognition (NER).\n",
    "The goal is to identify whether strings in text represent names of people, organizations, or locations.\n",
    "An example instance looks like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    [PER Wolff] , currently a journalist in [LOC Argentina] , played with\n",

    "\n",
    "| Template             | Number of Features |\n",

    "The $w_{-3}$ feature template corresponds to $V$ features where the $i$th feature is 1 if the third word to the left of the target word has ID $i$.\n",
    "The $w_{-1} \\& w_{+1}$ feature template corresponds to $V \\times V$ features where there is one feature for every unique pair words.\n",
    "For example, feature $(i - 1) \\times V + j$ is a binary feature that is 1 if the word 1 to the left of the target has ID $i$ and the first word to the right of the target has ID $j$.\n",
    "In practice, you will not need to keep track of the feature IDs.\n",
    "Instead, each feature will be given a name such as \"$w_{-1}=\\textrm{the} \\& w_{+1}=\\textrm{cat}$\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In total, all of the above feature templates correspond to a very large number of features.\n",
    "However, for each word, there will be exactly 9 features which are active (non-zero), so the feature vector is quite sparse.\n",
    "You will represent this as a dictionary which maps from the feature name to the value.\n",
    "In the provided Python template, we have implemented a couple of the features for you to demonstrate how to compute them and what the naming scheme should look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to deal with the first two words and the last two words in a sentence, we will add special symbol \"SSS\" and \"EEE\" to the vocabulary to represent the words before the first word and the words after the last word.\n",
    "Notice that in the test data you may encounter a word that was not observed in training, and therefore is not in your dictionary.\n",
    "In this case, you cannot generate a feature for it, resulting in less than 7 active features in some of the test examples."
